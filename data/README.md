## About

This folder contains the data necessary to run analysis from [our paper](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/geb.12818). 

The "dbase_good_24_Feb_2017.csv" file contains the locality information for _Pelargonium_ species from South Africa.

The "species_areas_in_grid.csv" file contains the estimates of species range sizes, calculated based on the number 
of unique grid cells occupied for each species used in our analyses.

Finally, the "tree.sub.u.tre", is a phylogenetic hypothesis for _Pelargonium_, used for PGLS analyses.
